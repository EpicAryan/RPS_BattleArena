Welcome to RPS_BATTLEARENA - the Rock, Paper, Scissors game!

## Overview

RPS_BATTLEARENA is a simple yet engaging game where players compete against the computer by choosing between rock, paper, or scissors. The game follows the classic rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. The goal is to outsmart your opponent and win as many rounds as possible!
